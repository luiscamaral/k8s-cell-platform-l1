  - namespace.yaml
  # ca/ca-issuer.yaml contains the full bootstrap chain:
  # selfsigned-bootstrap → homelab-ca Certificate → internal-ca ClusterIssuer
  # Applied separately via Makefile after Helm install
  # Uncomment for Let's Encrypt support:
  # - issuers/letsencrypt-staging.yaml
  # - issuers/letsencrypt-prod.yaml

# Helm chart is installed via Makefile, not kustomize
# CA resources are applied post-install in correct order
